# Note
* ApplicationCommands cannot be used in MVVM.
* InputBinding.CommandParameter is not DependencyProperty so cannot pass a UI.
* Use Behavior to access KeyEventArgs or MouseEventArgs.
  * KeyBinding cannot access KeyEventArgs.
 Â * MouseBinding cannot access MouseEventArgs.
* How to make the UI thread wait until a non-UI thread is done.
```csharp
await Task.Run(() => IamNonUiThread());
```

# Best practices
* Omit Grid.Row="0" and Grid.Column="0" as they are optional.
* A rather than B
  * Use {Binding Property1} rather than {Binding Path=Property1} as "Path=" is optional.
  * Use attribute syntax rather than property element syntax
    * For example, use \<Button Content="Content1" /> rather than \<Button>Content1\<Button/>
